Strategy
==========
The HQ will be responsible for creating PASTRs and for deploying soldiers.

Each soldier will be either an attack soldier or a defense soldier. Attack soldiers will attempt to get as close to the opponent HQ as possible before placing a noise tower. Defense soldiers will sneak as far from HQ as possible before encountering an enemy, and then run back to HQ, herding cows in the process.
